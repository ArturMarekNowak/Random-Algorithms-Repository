## General info
All algorithms are developed in C, C++, C# and Python with some Makefile when necessery. Each catlog has four subdirectories, one for each language.

## Technologies
* Vim 
* C compiler: cc
* C++ compiler: g++
* C#: mcs
* Python: python 3.8.5


## Setup
Provided you have previously mentioned compilers all you need to enter desired folder and make or run proper compiler/interpreter.

## Status
Project is: _in progress_, I am trying to do at least one algorithm a day.
