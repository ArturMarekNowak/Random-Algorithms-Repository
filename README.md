# Random Algorithms Repository
> This repository contains a number of algorithms I have decided to implement. 

## Table of contents
* [General info](#general-info)
* [Technologies](#technologies)
* [Setup](#setup)
* [Status](#status)

## General info
All algorithms are developed in C, C++, C# and Python with some Makefile when necessery. Each catlog has four subdirectories, one for each language.

## Technologies
* Vim 
* C compiler: cc 9.3.0
* C++ compiler: g++ 9.3.0
* C# compiler: mcs 6.8.0.105
* Python interpreter: python 3.8.5
* Haskell compiler: ghci 8.6.5

## Setup
Provided you have previously mentioned compilers all you need to enter desired folder and make or run proper compiler/interpreter.

## Status
Project is: _in progress_, I am trying to do at least one algorithm a day.
